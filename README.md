# Kubernetes Environment Variables Converter

Convert Kubernetes environment variables to .env format. Click [here](https://k8s-env-converter.netlify.app) if you wish to check out the website.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Motivation

Constantly switching between environments locally can be time-consuming and error-prone if hosted environments use Kubernetes. This is due to the difference between environment variables's formats.
